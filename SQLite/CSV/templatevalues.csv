7|1|1|7|"_____(Insert Rank and Name) on _____(Insert Date and Time), you disobeyed a lawful order or regulation in that you __________(Describe Events)  (See notes page for example)
Your failure to obey an order cannot and will not be tolerated.

I am recommending the following action(s) be taken and where necessary referred to the Commander for action:
____ Punishment under UCMJ
____ Corrective training
____Bar to reenlistment
____Flagging action
____Other
I am counseling you for the conduct noted above.  If this conduct continues, action may be initiated to separate you from the Army IAW AR 635-200.  If you are involuntary separated, you could receive an Honorable Discharge, a General (Under Honorable Conditions) Discharge, or Under Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge.  An Honorable Discharge is a separation with honor based on the quality of service, which meets the standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty.  A General Discharge is a separation under honorable conditions, based on a military record being satisfactory but not sufficiently meritorious to warrant an Honorable Discharge.  A discharge Under Other Than Honorable Conditions is based upon a pattern of behavior of one or more acts or omissions that constitutes a significant departure from the conduct expected of a Soldier.  An Honorable Discharge may be awarded under any provisions.  A General Discharge may be awarded for separation under Chapter 5, Chapter 9, Chapter 13 and Chapter 14.  An Under Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge may be awarded for separation under Chapter 14 for misconduct.  If you receive an Honorable Discharge, you will be qualified for most benefits resulting from military service.  An involuntary Honorable Discharge, however, will disqualify you from reenlistment for some period of time and may disqualify you from receiving transitional benefits (e.g., commissary, housing, health benefits) and the Montgomery GI Bill if you have not met other program requirements.  If you receive a General Discharge, you will be disqualified from reenlisting in the service for some period of time and you will be ineligible for some military and VA administered benefits, including the Montgomery GI Bill.  If you receive a discharge Under Other Than Honorable Conditions, you will be ineligible for reenlistment and for most benefits, including payments of accrued leave, transitional benefits, the Montgomery GI Bill, and possibly transportation of dependents and household goods to home.   You may also face difficulty in obtaining civilian employment as employers have a low regard for General and Under Other Than Honorable conditions discharges.  Although there are agencies to which you may apply to have your characterization of service changed, it is unlikely that such application will be successful. _______ (Soldier's initials)"
