8|"1.	In this counseling session a Soldier has provided prescription medication to another individual. Let's look at two possible situations.
a.	A Soldier is provided Motrin 800 3 and to another Soldier to take as a result of knee pain after a road march. 
i.	The Soldier stated he did not know there was a problem in providing this drug as he considered it an over the counter medication.
ii.	Soldier sincerely apologized and apparently was sincere in his comments.
iii.	Based on this scenario it appears this was simply a Soldier that lacked knowledge and had no desire or intent to deceive.
iv.	The Soldier can be directed to teach a class to the unit or prepare a policy letter on the proper procedures that should be taken if a member of the command observers someone providing prescription medication to another member of the unit.
v.	Consider having the class or policy letter approved by JAG for legal sufficiency. Once approved require every member of the command to either attend the class or read the policy letter.  Then have them sign a form stating they attended the class or have read and understand the policy letter and understand the consequences for failing to maintain the standard.  By doing this you eliminate the possibility of individuals using the ""I didn't know"" excuse.

b.	A Soldier is prescribed a narcotic pain reliever and provides this medication to another Soldier for pain relief or to get high. The Soldier that received the medication has come up positive during a urine analysis.  

i.	At this time you have reason to believe that a crime may have been committed. You should consult with your senior leadership chain to determine if the Soldier should be read their rights or execute a right's warning statement.

ii.	The command should then investigate the issue with the Soldier that came up positive in the urine analysis and the Soldier that allegedly provided the medication.

iii.	The Soldier providing the medication was definitely wrong but to what degree was it intentional or was it done because the Soldier was naÂ‹ve?  Is it possible the Soldier that came up positive may have taken the medication from the other Soldier without his permission? Do you have physical proof the Soldier provided the medication to the Soldier who came up positive for drug use?

iv.	In this case regardless of the reason the one or both of the Soldiers actions had an adverse impact on the Soldier(s) involved and the unit.  In addition these Soldiers could have potentially exposed other members of the unit to harm as a result of the impact of the narcotic drug use.
v.	This example is more severe than the previous example.  In this case the consequences for failing illegally providing and illegally taking prescription medication could have been catastrophic.  Therefore it must be handled with more severe penalties.
vi.	After a careful investigation serious punishment should be considered based on the facts of the investigation. For example: letter of reprimand, bullet comment on the evaluation report, Article 15,or separation.  If UCMJ is recommended and the individual is an NCO or Officer check local policies and procedures to ensure a superior commander has not reserved UCMJ authority for this type of offense.
"|"1.	Do you have reason to believe the Soldier may have committed a crime? If so seek senior leader guidance before proceeding.
2.	Before attempting to gain access to medical information contact the chain of command to ensure that the Soldier's medical and privacy rights are not violated.
3.	Did the use of the medication have an adverse impact on the Soldier's health, behavior, family, or where the actions prejudicial to the good order and discipline of the Army?
4.	Did the Soldier provide medication to another individual? 
5.	Providing medication to an unauthorized user may be a punishable offense?
6.	Does the prescription bottle have information on the bottle stating: illegal to provide to others, do not operate machinery, etc?
7.	What was the Soldier's motive for providing the medication to someone else?
8.	If the Soldier failed to take medication as directed then they may be subject to Article 92 of the UCMJ as well as other punitive and administrative action.
9.	What type of medication was the Soldier prescribed?  Pain reliever, Antibiotic, etc.
10.	Based on the date of the prescription how much medication should be remaining in the container? If medication is over consumed this could indicate abuse under consumption may indicate the Soldier failed to take as directed or the medication was to be used on an as needed basis.
11.	Is the prescription older than 6 months from the dispense date?
12.	Medication use: Typically: if older than 6 months the prescription may not be a valid prescription and the command should determine if the medication should be confiscated. Check local policy and procedure.
13.	If the prescription is not current why was it in the Soldier's possession?
14.	Are there any indications of medication abuse: excessive use, mixing pills with alcohol or other drugs, positive urine analysis, providing to others, ingestion by un-prescribed means such as: crushing or snorting. 
15.	Was the medication used for the illness or injury other than it was prescribed for? For example: a Soldier obtains a prescription pain killer for a knee injury and 6 months later uses it for a headache.  This would be most likely be considered improper use.
16.	Is this medication one that if not taken as directed could adversely impact the Soldier and/or others in the unit? For example: Antibiotics, Steroids, etc. 
17.	Was the medication prescribed by a civilian doctor (meaning a doctor not working for the military)?
18.	If prescribed by a civilian doctor did the Soldier have the prescription verified by a military doctor upon returning to the installation?
19.	If the Soldier did not have the prescription verified what is the Soldier's reason for failing to do so?
20.	If prescribed by a military doctor or a civilian doctor working for the military then the action may constitute failure to obey an order.
21.	Should the Soldier be given a urine analysis?
22.	Should the Soldier be referred to the Substance Abuse?

4-1. Military discipline
a. Military discipline is founded upon self-discipline, respect for properly constituted authority, and the embracing
of the professional Army ethic with its supporting individual values. Military discipline will be developed by individual and group training to create a mental attitude resulting in proper conduct and prompt obedience to lawful military authority.
b. While military discipline is the result of effective training, it is affected by every feature of military life. It is
manifested in individuals and units by cohesion, bonding, and a spirit of teamwork; by smartness of appearance and
action; by cleanliness and maintenance of dress, equipment, and quarters; by deference to seniors and mutual respect
between senior and subordinate personnel; by the prompt and willing execution of both the letter and the spirit of the
legal orders of their lawful commanders; and by fairness, justice, and equity for all Soldiers, regardless of race,
religion, color, gender, and national origin.
c. Commanders and other leaders will maintain discipline according to the policies of this chapter, applicable laws
and regulations, and the orders of seniors.
4-2. Obedience to orders
All persons in the military Service are required to strictly obey and promptly execute the legal orders of their lawful
seniors.

AR 635-200
1-15. Guidance
A substantial investment is made in training persons enlisted or inducted into the Army; therefore, this general
guidance will be considered when initiating separation action.
a. Unless separation is mandatory, the potential for rehabilitation and further useful military service will be
considered by the separation authority; where applicable, the administrative separation board will also consider these
factors. If separation is warranted despite the potential for rehabilitation, consider suspending the separation, if
authorized.
b. Adequate counseling and rehabilitation measures will be taken before initiating separation action against a Soldier
when the reason for separation so specifies. An alleged or established inadequacy in previous rehabilitation efforts does not provide a legal bar to separation.
c. When deciding retention or separation in a case, consider the following factors:
(1) The seriousness of the events or conditions that form the basis for initiation of separation proceedings. Also
consider the effect of the Soldier's continued retention on military discipline, good order, and morale.
(2) The likelihood that the events or conditions that led to separation proceedings will continue or recur.
( 3 ) The likelihood that the Soldier will be a disruptive or undesirable influence in present or future duty assignments.
(4) The Soldier's ability to perform duties effectively now and in the future, including potential for advancement or
leadership.
(5) The Soldier's rehabilitative potential.
(6) The Soldier's entire military record, including-
( a ) Past contributions to the Army, assignments, awards and decorations, evaluation ratings, and letters of commendation.
(b) Memoranda of reprimand or admonition, counseling records, records of nonjudicial punishment, records of
conviction by court-martial and records of involvement with civilian authorities.
(c) Any other matter deemed relevant by the board or the separation authority, including specialized training, duties,
and experience of persons entrusted by this regulation with making recommendations or decisions on separation or
retention.
(d) Adverse information from a prior enlistment or period of military service only when such information would
have a direct and strong probative value in determining whether separation is appropriate.
1. This includes records of nonjudicial punishment and convictions by court-martial. Such information ordinarily
will be used only in those cases involving conduct repeated over an extended period of time.
2. In unusual situations, conduct from a prior enlistment that does not constitute a pattern of conduct manifested
over an extended period of time may be considered in determining whether retention or separation is warranted. For
example, a single incident of misconduct occurring in the prior period of service that, by itself, would warrant
separation may be considered if the officials in the Soldier's chain of command neither knew, nor reasonably should
have known of, at the time the Soldier re-enlisted.
3. Commanders who believe that a Soldier's case represents an unusual situation within the meaning of this
paragraph should request guidance from the Commanding General (AHRC-EPR-F), 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria,
VA 22332-0478.
(e) Isolated incidents and events that are remote in time normally have little probative value in determining whether
administrative separation should be effected.
d. Commanders will review all administrative separations involving known victims of sexual assault (see AR
600-20, chap 8) and any Soldier who answered ""Yes"" to either of the questions cited under either paragraph 2-2i or
2-4h. Unless otherwise directed, this review must consider the following:
(1) Whether the separation appears to be in retaliation for the Soldier filing an unrestricted report of sexual assault.
If so, consult with the servicing office of the staff judge advocate or other legal office.
(2) Whether the separation involves a medical condition that is related to the sexual assault, to include Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). If so, consult with the appropriate medical personnel.
(3) Whether the separation is in the best interest of the Army, the Soldier, or both. If not, consult with the servicing
staff judge advocate.
(4) The status of the case against the alleged offender, and the effect of the Soldier's (victim's) separation on the
disposition or prosecution of the case. If the case is still open, consult the servicing Criminal Investigation Division
unit and staff judge advocate.
e. Each commander in the chain of command must include a statement on his/her endorsement certifying review in
accordance with paragraph 1-15d of this recommendation. Commanders will ensure compliance with AR 340-21 and AR 25-55.

1-16. Counseling and rehabilitative requirements
a. General. Army leaders at all levels must be continually aware of their obligation to provide purpose, direction,
and motivation to Soldiers. It is essential that Soldiers who falter, but have the potential to serve honorably and well,
be given every opportunity to succeed. Effective leadership is particularly important in the case of Soldiers serving
their initial enlistments. Except as otherwise indicated in this regulation, commanders must make maximum use of
counseling and rehabilitation before determining that a Soldier has no potential for further useful service and, therefore,
should be separated. In this regard, commanders will ensure that adequate counseling and rehabilitative measures are
taken before initiating separation proceedings for the following reasons:
(1) Involuntary separation due to parenthood. (See para 5-8.)
(2) Personality disorder. (See para 5-13.)
(3) Other designated physical or mental conditions. (See para 5-17)
(4) Entry-level performance and conduct. (See chap 11.)
(5) Unsatisfactory performance. (See chap 13.)
(6) Minor disciplinary infractions or a pattern of misconduct. (See para 14-12a and b.)
(7) Failure to meet body fat standards. (See chap 18.)
b. Counseling. When a Soldier's conduct or performance becomes unacceptable, the commander will ensure that a
responsible official formally notifies the Soldier of his/her deficiencies. At least one formal counseling session is
required before separation proceedings may be initiated for one or more of the reasons specified in a, above. In
addition, there must be evidence that the Soldier's deficiencies continued after the initial formal counseling.
(1) The number and frequency of formal counseling sessions are discretionary. Such factors as the length of time
since the prior counseling, the Soldier's performance and conduct during the intervening period, and the commander's
assessment of the Soldier's potential for becoming a fully satisfactory Soldier, must be considered in determining if
further counseling is needed.
(2) Counseling will be comprehensive and in accordance with chapter 17 of this regulation and will include the
reason(s) it is being administered, the date, the fact that separation proceedings may be initiated if the deficiencies
continue, and other guidance as appropriate.
(3) Each counseling session must be recorded in writing. DA Form 4856 (General Counseling Form) will be used
for this purpose.
(4) The Soldier's counseling or personal records must reflect that he/she was formally counseled concerning his/her
deficiencies and given a reasonable opportunity to overcome or correct them.
c. Rehabilitation. Except as provided in d, below, the following rehabilitative measures are required prior to
initiating separation proceedings for entry-level performance and conduct (see chap 11), unsatisfactory performance
(see chap 13), or minor disciplinary infractions/patterns of misconduct (see chap 14):
(1) Trainees. Soldiers undergoing initial entry or other training will be recycled (reassigned between training
companies or, where this is not feasible, between training platoons) at least once.
(2) Other than trainees. Soldiers not in training status will be locally reassigned at least once, with a minimum of 3
months of duty in each unit. Reassignment should be between battalion-sized units or between brigade-sized or larger units when considered necessary by the local commander.
(3) Permanent change of station (PCS) transfer. PCS funds normally will not be used for rehabilitative transfers.
However, in meritorious cases where it is determined that a Soldier with potential to be a distinct asset to the Army
would benefit from a change in commanders, associates, and living or working conditions, the commander exercising
general court-martial jurisdiction may authorize PCS transfer within the same command. As an alternative, a request
for reassignment to another command may be submitted to Headquarters, Department of the Army (AHRC-EP appropriate career branch), 2461 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22332-0478.
d. Waivers.
(1) Waiver of the counseling requirement is not authorized.
(2) The rehabilitative transfer requirements in chapters 11, 13, and 14 may be waived by the separation authority in
circumstances where common sense and sound judgment indicate that such transfer will serve no useful purpose or
produce a quality Soldier. Such circumstances may include:
(a) Two consecutive failures of the Army physical fitness test.
(b) Pregnancy while in entry-level status.
(c) Highly disruptive or potentially suicidal behavior, particularly in reception battalions.
(d) Active resistance of rehabilitative efforts.
(e) Soldiers assigned to small installations or at remote locations.
(f) Situations in which transfer to a different duty station would be detrimental to the Army or the Soldier (for
example, indebtedness, participation in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Program, Mental Health Treatment Program, and so forth).
(3) Waiver of rehabilitative transfer may be granted at any time on or before the date the separation authority
approves or disapproves the separation proceedings. Waiver authority may be withheld by a higher separation authority in a particular case, a class or category of cases, or all cases. Decision to withhold waiver authority will be announced in writing.

AR 600-8-24 Officers Only
1-22. Types of administrative discharge/character of service
When an officer's tour of AD is terminated due to discharge, retirement, or REFRAD, the period of service will be
characterized as "" Honorable,"" ""General"" (""Under Honorable Conditions""), ""Under Other Than Honorable,"" or
""Dishonorable"" (warrant officers who do not hold a commission only), depending on the circumstances. The character of service will be predicated on the officer's behavior and performance while a member of the Army. Characterization normally will be based on a pattern of behavior and duty performance rather than an isolated incident. However, there are circumstances in which conduct reflected by a single incident may provide the basis of characterization of service.
a. Honorable characterization of service (HD). An officer will normally receive an Honorable characterization of
service when the quality of the officer's service has met the standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty, or the final revocation of a security clearance under DODD 5200.2-R and AR 380-67 for reasons that do not involve acts of misconduct, for an officer. Department of Defense (DD) Form 256A (Honorable Discharge Certificate) will be furnished to a discharged officer; however, a certificate is not issued when an officer is released from AD. When the separation is based solely on preservice activities, substandard performance of duty, or final revocation of a security clearance under DODD 5200.2-R and AR 380-67 for reasons that do not involve acts of misconduct, it will be Honorable.
b. General Under Honorable Conditions characterization of service (GD). An officer will normally receive an
Under Honorable Conditions characterization of service when the officer's military record is satisfactory but not
sufficiently meritorious to warrant an Honorable discharge. A separation under honorable conditions will normally be appropriate when an officer-
(1) Submits an unqualified resignation or a request for REFRAD under circumstances involving misconduct.
(2) Is separated based on misconduct, including misconduct for which punishment was imposed, which renders the
officer unsuitable for further service, unless an Under Other Than Honorable Conditions separation is appropriate.
(3) Is discharged for physical disability resulting from intentional misconduct or willful neglect, or which was
incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.
(4) Is discharged for the final revocation of a security clearance under DODD 5200.2-R and AR 380-67 as a result
of an act or acts of misconduct, including misconduct for which punishment was imposed, unless a discharge Under
Other Than Honorable Conditions is appropriate.
c. Under Other Than Honorable Conditions characterization of service (OTH). A discharge Under Other Than
Honorable Conditions is an administrative separation from the service under conditions other than honorable. A
discharge certificate will not be issued. An officer will normally receive an ""Under Other Than Honorable Conditions"" when they-
(1) Resign for the good of the service (chap 3).
(2) Are dropped from the rolls of the Army per paragraph 5-15.
(3) Are involuntarily separated due to misconduct, moral or professional dereliction, or for the final revocation of a
security clearance under DODD 5200.2-R and AR 380-67 as a result of an act or acts of misconduct, including
misconduct for which punishment was imposed.
(4) Are discharged following conviction by civilian authorities (see para 2-33).
d. Dishonorable characterization of service. A court-martial may sentence a warrant officer who is not commissioned to a Dishonorable Discharge. A discharge certificate will not be issued.
e. Undetermined characterization of service. An officer's service will be characterized as ""to be determined"" when
released from AD duty when being processed for elimination action (chap 4).
f. No formal discharge certificate. No formal discharge certificate will be issued when the officer is-
(1) Dropped from the rolls of the Army (see paras 5-15 and 5-16).
(2) Dismissed as a result of sentence of court-martial.
(3) Removed under the criminal code of the United States.
(4) Discharged Under Other Than Honorable Conditions.
(5) Separated with a Dishonorable discharge (applies only to a warrant officer who does not hold a commission).
g. Release or discharge from active duty. A DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty)
will be furnished as prescribed in AR 635-5 to an officer who is separated from AD after completing 90 calendar days of continuous AD.

4-2. Reasons for elimination
While not all inclusive, when one of the following or similar conditions exist, elimination action may be or will be
initiated as indicated below for-
a. Substandard performance of duty.
(1) A downward trend in overall performance resulting in an unacceptable record of efficiency, or a consistent
record of mediocre service.
(2) Failure to keep pace or to progress with contemporaries, as demonstrated by a low record of efficiency when
compared with other officers of the same grade and competitive category.
(3) Failure to exercise necessary leadership or command expected of an officer of their grade.
(4) Failure of an officer to absorb technical proficiency required for grade and competitive category.
(5) Failure to properly perform assignments commensurate with an officer's grade and experience.
(6) Apathy, defective attitudes, or other characteristic disorders to include inability or unwillingness to expend
effort.
(7) Failure to respond to alcohol or drug problem rehabilitation efforts in a reasonable length of time. (See AR 600-
85 for further explanation.) Elimination action will be initiated. Care should be taken to avoid the inclusion of limiteduse evidence, as defined in AR 600-85, chapter 6.
(8) Failure to conform to prescribed standards of dress, personal appearance, or military deportment.
(9) Failure to achieve satisfactory progress after enrollment in the Army weight control program or failure to
maintain the weight/body fat standards established under the provisions of AR 600-9 after removal from an established weight control program. Elimination action will be initiated. This provision does not include those judge advocates and AMEDD officers who have incurred a statutory ADSO for participating in Army sponsored education and training programs such as the FLEP (10 USC 2004), Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program, or the Uniform Services University of the Health Sciences (10 USC, chapters 104, 105).
(10) When no medical problems exist, and an officer has two consecutive failures of the APFT, elimination action
will be initiated. This provision does not include those judge advocates and AMEDD officers who have incurred a
statutory ADSO for participating in Army sponsored education and training programs such as the FLEP (10 USC
2004), Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship, or the Uniform Services University of the Health Sciences (10
USC, chapters 104, 105).
(11) Failure of a course at a service school for academic reasons by a probationary or nonprobationary RA officer.
For failure by an RC officer, see paragraph 2-33.
(12) Failure of a probationary officer to resign under paragraph 3-9 when their commander determines the best
interest of the Government and the individual can be served by the officer's discharge.
(13) The discovery of other conditions concerning a probationary officer that, had they been known at the time of
appointment, would have precluded appointment.
(14) The discovery of any other condition concerning a probationary officer that indicates the officer's retention in
the Army would not be in the best interest of the U.S.
(15) Probationary RA commissioned and warrant officers entering AD who are confirmed human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) positive within 180 calendar days of their original appointment or probationary USAR, ARNG commission and warrant officers who report for initial entry training in an AD (other than ADT) status and are confirmed HIV positive within 180 calendar days of reporting to AD will be processed for elimination.
(16) Failure to establish an adequate Family Care Plan in accordance with AR 600-20, paragraph 5-5.
b. Misconduct, moral or professional dereliction, or in the interests of national security.
(1) Discreditable or intentional failure to meet personal financial obligations.
(2) Mismanagement of personal affairs that are unfavorably affecting an officer's performance of duty.
(3) Mismanagement of personal affairs to the discredit of the Army.
( 4 ) Intentional omission or misstatement of factin in official statements or records for the purpose of misrepresentation.
(5) Acts of personal misconduct (including but not limited to acts committed while in a drunken or drug intoxicated
state).
(6) Rescinded.
(7) Intentional neglect of or failure to perform duties.
(8) Conduct unbecoming an officer.

AR 623-3
3-28. Participation in the Army Substance Abuse Program

A rated Soldier who voluntarily enters the Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) for an alcohol or drug abuse problem that has not been detected by the chain of command will not be penalized by mention of ASAP participation in an evaluation report. This would discourage voluntary entry in the ASAP upon self-recognition of the need for help. In those cases where alcohol and drug abuse has resulted in substandard performance and/or disciplinary problems, subsequent voluntary entry in ASAP does not preclude rating officials from recording substandard performance or disciplinary problems on an evaluation report. Rating officials cannot use information derived from ASAP records in their evaluations. Once a Soldier has been identified in an evaluation report as having an alcohol or drug abuse problem based on information obtained independently of the ASAP-
a. Voluntary entry into the ASAP or successful rehabilitation will be mentioned as a factor to the rated Soldier's credit.
b. The rating chain will note status of a rated Soldier's rehabilitation progress or outcome in the current evaluation or in later reports.

Note: This does not prevent the behavior that led to the incident from being addressed in the evaluation report.
