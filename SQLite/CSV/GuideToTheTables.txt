Okay a fast rundown on how this works.

------


FORMS

Fairly straightforward, just IDs and names the base forms used by the program.


------


FORM FIELDS

This lists all the fields associated with the forms in the form table and gives each a unique ID.  This is used by the "templatevalues" table to list what the initial value for each field for a template document, and the "usergeneratedvalues" table to store the value the user has generated for each field in a document.


------


DOCUMENT TYPES

Just an ID / name pairing that says whether a document is a counseling, documentation, or user uploaded document.  (Used to know how to handle it when someone clicks "edit document" on the soldiers page - this is going to need to change later to Counseling, Memo, Letter, etc., instead of just Documentation..)


------


DOCUMENTNAMES

Just a list of document names with an ID for each.  This is here because it's expected that a ton of documents generated by the user will share a common name (ie. the template name) and it's a lot faster to just reference an index and use a key/value pair than copy the name over and over again (not to mention keeps the database smaller (and thus faster for other queries as well)).  This table gets referenced by the "templates" table.


------

TEMPLATE GROUPS

This is where we can create those groupings for templates like "AWOL" and "LEAVE" and whatnot so we have the nice organized tree lists on the counseling page.  Just an ID/Name here.


------


TEMPLATES

This is where we create the entries that show up in the tree views and are available for creation..  There are a few things we have to let the program know:  what group the template is in, what it's name is, what form it uses, and whether it's a counseling or documentation


- "templateid" is obvious enough  
- "templategroupid" references table "templategroups" column "templategroupid" to put this template in a group
- "documentnameid" references table "documentnames" column "documentnameid" 
- "formid" references table "forms" column "formid"
- "documenttypeid" references table "documenttypes" column "documenttypeid" 

* For entering new counselings, you'll just need to give it a new ID, the group you want it in, a name ID, and then 1 for the last two columns..   for new documentation we'll have to add stuff like LetterTemplate.doc, MemoTemplate.doc, etc. to the Forms table, add the fields, then use those IDs and add their typeIDs.  (Since we're going to templates for each of those, we may be able to push typeid into the forms table completely.)


------


TEMPLATE VALUES

Provides the initial values for each entry in the templates table (right now, it's only got values for two of them as fillers, but eventually for each one.)

templatevalueid is just a unique ID for each entry..

templateid just points to which tempalte it is, formid/formfieldid just point to the form field being used (the group of them are supposed to be a guarantee that the same field can't be accidentally entered multiple times or that fields associated with the wrong document can't be used, as the DB engine would catch it and throw it back, but since we're doing it via text we'll just have to be careful.)



------


COUNSELING CHECKLISTS


This is where the "general", "event specific" and "extract" stuff goes for each template.
